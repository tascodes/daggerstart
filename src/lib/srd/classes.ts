      "# BEASTFORM OPTIONS\n\nWhen you use your “Beastform” feature, choose a creature category of your tier or lower. At the GM’s discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category.\n\nBeastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details:\n\n- **Creature Category:** Each category’s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).\n- **Character Trait:** While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.\n- **Attack Rolls:** When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.\n- **Evasion:** While transformed, you add the creature’s Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion +2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form.\n- **Advantage:** Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.\n- **Features:** Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dexterous movement—but they’re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform.\n\n## TIER 1\n\n### AGILE SCOUT\n\n(Fox, Mouse, Weasel, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d4 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** deceive, locate, sneak\n\n***Agile:*** Your movement is silent, and you can spend a Hope to move up to Far range without rolling.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### HOUSEHOLD FRIEND\n\n(Cat, Dog, Rabbit, etc.)\n\n> Instinct +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Instinct d6 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** climb, locate, protect\n\n***Companion:*** When you Help an Ally, you can roll a d8 as your advantage die.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### NIMBLE GRAZER\n\n(Deer, Gazelle, Goat, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +3 | Melee Agility d6 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** leap, sneak, sprint\n\n***Elusive Prey:*** When an attack roll against you would succeed, you can mark a Stress and roll a d4. Add the result to your Evasion against this attack.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### PACK PREDATOR\n\n(Coyote, Hyena, Wolf, etc.)\n\n> Strength +2 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d8+2 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** attack, sprint, track\n\n***Hobbling Strike:*** When you succeed on an attack against a target within Melee range, you can mark a Stress to make the target temporarily Vulnerable.\n\n***Pack Hunting:*** When you succeed on an attack against the same target as an ally who acts immediately before you, add a d8 to your damage roll.\n\n### AQUATIC SCOUT\n\n(Eel, Fish, Octopus, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d4 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** navigate, sneak, swim\n\n***Aquatic:*** You can breathe and move naturally underwater.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### STALKING ARACHNID\n\n(Tarantula, Wolf Spider, etc.)\n\n> Finesse +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Finesse d6+1 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** attack, climb, sneak\n\n***Venomous Bite:*** When you succeed on an attack against a target within Melee range, the target becomes temporarily Poisoned. A Poisoned creature takes 1d10 direct physical damage each time they act.\n\n***Webslinger:*** You can create a strong web material useful for both adventuring and battle. The web is resilient enough to support one creature. You can temporarily Restrain a target within Close range by succeeding on a Finesse Roll against them.\n\n### MIGHTY STRIDER\n\n(Camel, Horse, Zebra, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d8+1 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** leap, navigate, sprint\n\n***Carrier:*** You can carry up to two willing allies with you when you move.\n\n***Trample:*** Mark a Stress to move up to Close range in a straight line and make an attack against all targets within Melee range of the line. Targets you succeed against take d8+1 physical damage using your Proficiency and are temporarily Vulnerable.\n\n## TIER 2\n\n### ARMORED SENTRY\n\n(Armadillo, Pangolin, Turtle, etc.)\n\n> Strength +1 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d8+2 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** dig, locate, protect\n\n***Armored Shell:*** Your hardened exterior gives you resistance to physical damage.

While in your shell, physical damage is reduced by a number equal to your Armor Score (after applying resistance), but you can't perform other actions without leaving this form.\n\n***Cannonball:*** Mark a Stress to allow an ally to throw or launch you at an adversary. To do so, the ally makes an attack roll using Agility or Strength (their choice) against a target within Close Range. On a success, the adversary takes d12+2 physical damage using the thrower’s Proficiency. You can spend a Hope to target an additional adversary within Very Close range of the first. The second target takes half the damage dealt to the first target.\n\n### POWERFUL BEAST\n\n(Bear, Bull, Moose, etc.)\n\n> Strength +3 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d10+4 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** navigate, protect, scare\n\n***Rampage:*** When you roll a 1 on a damage die, you can roll a d10 and add the result to the damage roll. Additionally, before you make an attack roll, you can mark a Stress to gain a +1 bonus to your Proficiency for that attack.\n\n***Thick Hide:*** You gain a +2 bonus to your damage thresholds.\n\n### STRIKING SERPENT\n\n(Cobra, Rattlesnake, Viper, etc.)\n\n> Finesse +1 | Evasion +2 | Very Close Finesse d8+4 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** climb, deceive, sprint\n\n***Venomous Strike:*** Make an attack against any number of targets within Very Close range.

Once per rest while you are airborne, you can ask the GM a question about the scene below you without needing to roll. The first time a character makes a roll to act on this information, they gain advantage on the roll.\n\n***Hollow Bones:*** You gain a -2 penalty to your damage thresholds.\n\n## TIER 3\n\n### GREAT PREDATOR\n\n(Dire Wolf, Velociraptor, Sabertooth Tiger, etc.)\n\n> Strength +2 | Evasion +2 | Melee Strength d12+8 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** attack, sneak, sprint\n\n***Carrier:*** You can carry up to two willing allies with you when you move.\n\n***Vicious Maul:*** When you succeed on an attack against a target, you can spend a Hope to make them temporarily Vulnerable and gain a +1 bonus to your Proficiency for this attack.\n\n### MIGHTY LIZARD\n\n(Alligator, Crocodile, Gila Monster, etc.)\n\n> Instinct +2 | Evasion +1 | Melee Instinct d10+7 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** attack, sneak, track\n\n***Physical Defense:*** You gain a +3 bonus to your damage thresholds.\n\n***Snapping Strike:*** When you succeed on an attack against a target within Melee range, you can spend a Hope to clamp that opponent in your jaws, making them temporarily Restrained and Vulnerable.\n\n### GREAT WINGED BEAST\n\n(Giant Eagle, Falcon, etc.)\n\n> Finesse +2 | Evasion +3 | Melee Finesse d8+6 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** deceive, distract, locate\n\n***Bird’s-Eye View:*** You can fly at will.

It is better to be a seraph’s ally than their enemy, as they are terrifying foes to those who defy their purpose.",
